to start the client:

install the required packages :
cd client-orb
npm install

then, once installed(still in client directory) :
npm start

to start the server :

run:
npm install

then, once installed :
run:
node main.js

however, in the main.js, in place of MONGO_CRED, use your own mongoDB credentials, and everything should run

NOTE: RUN THE SERVER FIRST, THEN THE CLIENT, AS THE CLIENT USES THE NEXT AVAILABLE PORT 3001
